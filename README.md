# KiCad - Shield for Arduino

## TODO design an electronic card with Kicad
- [x] Creat Kicad porject(Gas_sensor_shield)
- [] Design the circuit board
- [] Verification of electrical tests **ERC**
- [] Association of component footprints with their case
- [] Netlist generation
- [] Design of the electronic card
- [] Importing the netlist
- [] Component placement
- [] Define the design constraints of the electronic board ([stackup](https://www.emsproto.com/fr/standard-multi-layer-pcb-stackup))

# KiCad - Shield for Arduino

## TODO design an electronic card with Kicad
- [x] Creat Kicad porject(Gas_sensor_shield)
- [x] Design the circuit board
- [x] Verification of electrical tests **ERC**
- [x] Association of component footprints with their case
- [x] Netlist generation
- [x] Design of the electronic card
- [x] Importing the netlist
- [x] Component placement
- [] Define the design constraints of the electronic board ([stackup](https://www.emsproto.com/fr/standard-multi-layer-pcb-stackup))
- [] Route the tracks of the electronic board

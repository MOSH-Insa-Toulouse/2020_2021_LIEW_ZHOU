# TP MOSH Gas Sensor Application using LoRa Communication

## Tasks to be done
- [ ] Extend edge cut and filled zones so that they cover entire rn24835
- [ ] Insert ltspice schematics into git
- [ ] Create and insert datasheet into git
- [ ] Write readme (describe Arduino work, describe KiCAD work & remember to include answers for the ltspice part)
- [ ] Delete unnecessary tasks from this readme when everything is done
- [ ] Done

## Arduino
Describe Arduino application with LoRa TTN and alcohol gas sensor (MQ3). Remember to add image of node-red flow.

## Datasheet
Describe briefly datatsheet part and add related images. (maybe sensor pinout diagrams? ...)

## LTSpice
### Objective
The objective of designing this amplifier stage is ...

## KiCad - Shield for Arduino

### TODO design an electronic card with Kicad
- [x] Creat Kicad porject(Gas_sensor_shield)
- [x] Design the circuit board
- [x] Verification of electrical tests **ERC**
- [x] Association of component footprints with their case
- [x] Netlist generation
- [x] Design of the electronic card
- [x] Importing the netlist
- [x] Component placement
- [x] Define the design constraints of the electronic board ([stackup](https://www.emsproto.com/fr/standard-multi-layer-pcb-stackup))
- [x] Route the tracks of the electronic board
